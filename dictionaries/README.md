Tournament Word Lists
=====================

There are many variations on the idea of a legal list of words for playing word games. For example, Scrabble players may adopt the TWL06 (Tournament Word List 2006), SOWPODS (Collins Scrabble Words), etc. These can be useful in checking that the most common words in our corpora are also "valid." This may filter out proper nouns, non-standard modernisms, and other artifacts of the process of counting words.
